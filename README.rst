The *django-fluent-comments* module enhances the default appearance
of the django_comments_ or django.contrib.comments_ application to be directly usable in web sites.
The features are:

* Ajax-based preview and posting of comments
* Configurable form layouts using django-crispy-forms_ and settings to exclude fields.
* Comment moderation, using Akismet_ integration and auto-closing after N days.
* E-mail notification to the site managers of new comments.
* Optional threaded comments support via django-threadedcomments_.

The application is designed to be plug&play;
installing it should already give a better comment layout.

Installation
============

First install the module and django_comments, preferably in a virtual environment::

    pip install django-fluent-comments

Configuration
-------------

To use comments, the following settings are required:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'fluent_comments',  # must be before django_comments
        'crispy_forms',
        'django_comments',
        'django.contrib.sites',
    )

    CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap3'

    COMMENTS_APP = 'fluent_comments'

.. note::
   For older Django versions (up till 1.7), you can also use django.contrib.comments_ in the ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
   This packages uses either of those packages, depending on what is installed.

Add the following in ``urls.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns += patterns('',
        url(r'^blog/comments/', include('fluent_comments.urls')),
    )

Provide a template that displays the comments for the ``object`` and includes the required static files:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load comments static %}

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'fluent_comments/css/ajaxcomments.css' %}" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'fluent_comments/js/ajaxcomments.js' %}"></script>

    {% render_comment_list for object %}
    {% render_comment_form for object %}

The database can be created afterwards:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py runserver

Template for non-ajax pages
---------------------------

The templates which django_comments_ renders use a single base template for all layouts.
This template is empty by default since it's only serves as a placeholder.
To complete the configuration of the comments module, create a ``comments/base.html`` file
that maps the template blocks onto your website base template. For example:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends "mysite/base.html" %}{% load i18n %}

    {% block headtitle %}{% block title %}{% trans "Responses for page" %}{% endblock %}{% endblock %}

    {% block main %}
        <div id="comments-wrapper">
            {% block content %}{% endblock %}
        </div>
    {% endblock %}

In this example, the base template has a ``headtitle`` and ``main`` block,
which contain the ``content`` and ``title`` blocks that django_comments_ needs to see.
This application also outputs an ``extrahead`` block for a meta-refresh tag.
The ``extrahead`` block can be included in the site base template directly,
so it doesn't have to be included in the ``comments/base.html`` file.


CSS form layout
---------------

Form layouts generally differ across web sites, hence this application doesn't dictate a specific form layout.
Instead, this application uses django-crispy-forms_ which allows configuration of the form appearance.

The defaults are set to Bootstrap 3 layouts, but can be changed.

Switching form layouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By choosing a different form class, the form layout can be redefined at once:

The default is:

.. code-block:: python

    FLUENT_COMMENTS_FORM_CLASS = 'fluent_comments.forms.FluentCommentForm'

    FLUENT_COMMENTS_FORM_CSS_CLASS = 'comments-form form-horizontal'
    FLUENT_COMMENTS_LABEL_CSS_CLASS = 'col-sm-2'
    FLUENT_COMMENTS_FIELD_CSS_CLASS = 'col-sm-10'

You can replace the labels with placeholders using:

.. code-block:: python

    FLUENT_COMMENTS_FORM_CLASS = 'fluent_comments.forms.CompactLabelsCommentForm'

Or place some fields at a single row:

.. code-block:: python

    FLUENT_COMMENTS_FORM_CLASS = 'fluent_comments.forms.CompactCommentForm'

    # Optional settings for the compact style:
    FLUENT_COMMENTS_COMPACT_FIELDS = ('name', 'email', 'url')
    FLUENT_COMMENTS_COMPACT_GRID_SIZE = 12
    FLUENT_COMMENTS_COMPACT_COLUMN_CSS_CLASS = "col-sm-{size}"


Changing the field order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default is:

.. code-block:: python

    FLUENT_COMMENTS_FIELD_ORDER = ('name', 'email', 'url', 'comment')

For a more modern look, consider placing the comment first:

.. code-block:: python

    FLUENT_COMMENTS_FIELD_ORDER = ('comment', 'name', 'email', 'url')


Hiding form fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Form fields can be hidden using the following settings:

.. code-block:: python

    FLUENT_COMMENTS_EXCLUDE_FIELDS = ('name', 'email', 'url')

When `django-threadedcomments`_ in used, the ``title`` field can also be removed.


Using a custom form class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the settings above don't provide the layout you need,
you can define a custom form class entirely:

.. code-block:: python

    from fluent_comments.forms import CompactLabelsCommentForm


    class CommentForm(CompactLabelsCommentForm):
        """
        The comment form to use
        """

        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super(CommentForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self.fields['url'].label = "Website"  # Changed the label

And use that class in the ``FLUENT_COMMENTS_FORM_CLASS`` setting.
The ``helper`` attribute defines how the layout is constructed by django-crispy-forms_,
and should be redefined the change the field ordering or appearance.


Switching form templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the forms can be rendered with 2 well known CSS frameworks:

* `Bootstrap`_ The default template pack. The popular simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for user interfaces from Twitter.
* `Uni-form`_ Nice looking, well structured, highly customizable, accessible and usable forms.

The ``CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK`` setting can be used to switch between both layouts.
For more information, see the django-crispy-forms_ documentation.

Both CSS frameworks have a wide range of themes available, which should give a good head-start to have a good form layout.
In fact, we would encourage to adopt django-crispy-forms_ for all your applications to have a consistent layout across all your Django forms.

If your form CSS framework is not supported, you can create a template pack
for it and submit a pull request to the django-crispy-forms_ authors for inclusion.


Comment moderation
------------------

Comment moderation can be enabled for the specific models using:

.. code-block:: python

    from fluent_comments.moderation import moderate_model
    from myblog.models import BlogPost

    moderate_model(BlogPost,
        publication_date_field='publication_date',
        enable_comments_field='enable_comments',
    )

This code can be placed in a ``models.py`` file.
The provided field names are optional. By providing the field names,
the comments can be auto-moderated or auto-closed after a number of days since the publication date.

The following settings are available for comment moderation:

.. code-block:: python

    AKISMET_API_KEY = "your-api-key"
    AKISMET_BLOG_URL = "http://example.com"         # Optional, to override auto detection
    AKISMET_IS_TEST = False                         # Enable to make test runs

    FLUENT_CONTENTS_USE_AKISMET = True              # Enabled by default when AKISMET_API_KEY is set.
    FLUENT_COMMENTS_CLOSE_AFTER_DAYS = None         # Auto-close comments after N days
    FLUENT_COMMENTS_MODERATE_AFTER_DAYS = None      # Auto-moderate comments after N days.
    FLUENT_COMMENTS_AKISMET_ACTION = 'soft_delete'  # Set to 'moderate', 'soft_delete' or 'delete'

To use Akismet_ moderation, make sure the ``AKISMET_API_KEY`` setting is defined.


E-mail notification
-------------------

By default, the ``MANAGERS`` of a Django site will receive an e-mail notification of new comments.
This feature can be enabled or disabled using:

.. code-block:: python

    FLUENT_COMMENTS_USE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATION = True

The template ``comments/comment_notification_email.txt`` is used to generate the e-mail message.


Threaded comments
-----------------

There is build-in support for django-threadedcomments_ in this module.
It can be enabled using the following settings:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'threadedcomments',
    )

    COMMENTS_APP = 'fluent_comments'

The templates and admin interface adapt themselves automatically
to show the threaded comments.


Jquery widget
-------------

To use the jquery widget instead of the default ajaxcomments.js:

.. code-block:: python

    FLUENT_COMMENTS_JS = 'jquery.plugin.fluent_comments.js' # default:'ajaxcomments.js' | 'jquery.plugin.fluent_comments.js'


IP-Address detection
--------------------

This package stores the remote IP of the visitor in the model, and passes it to Akismet_.
The IP Address is read from the ``REMOTE_ADDR`` meta field.
In case your site is behind a HTTP proxy (e.g. using Gunicorn or a load balancer),
this would make all comments appear to be posted from the load balancer IP.

The best and most secure way to fix this, is using WsgiUnproxy_ middleware in your ``wsgi.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
    from django.conf import settings
    from wsgiunproxy import unproxy

    application = get_wsgi_application()
    application = unproxy(trusted_proxies=settings.TRUSTED_X_FORWARDED_FOR_IPS)(application)

In your ``settings.py``, you can define which hosts may pass the ``X-Forwarded-For``
header in the HTTP request. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    TRUSTED_X_FORWARDED_FOR_IPS = (
        '11.22.33.44',
        '192.168.0.1',
    )
