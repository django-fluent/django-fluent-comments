Introduction
============

The *django-fluent-comments* module enhances the default appearance
of the django.contrib.comments_ application to be directly usable in web sites.
The features are:

* Ajax-based preview and posting of comments
* Configurable form layouts using django-crispy-forms_ and settings to exclude fields.
* Comment moderation, using Akismet_ integration and auto-closing after N days.
* E-mail notification to the site managers of new comments.
* Optional threaded comments support via django-threadedcomments_.

The application is designed to be plug&play;
installing it should already give a better comment layout.

Installation
============

First install the module, preferably in a virtual environment. It can be installed from PyPI::

    pip install django-fluent-comments

Or the current folder can be installed::

    pip install .

Configuration
-------------

To use comments, the following settings are required::

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'fluent_comments',
        'crispy_forms',
        'django.contrib.comments',
    )

Add the following in ``urls.py``::

    urlpatterns += patterns('',
        url(r'^blog/comments/', include('fluent_comments.urls')),
    )

Provide a template that displays the comments for the ``object`` and includes the required static files::

    {% load comments %}

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}fluent_comments/css/ajaxcomments.css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}fluent_comments/js/ajaxcomments.js"></script>

    {% render_comment_list for object %}
    {% render_comment_form for object %}

The database can be created afterwards::

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py runserver

Template for non-ajax pages
---------------------------

The templates which django.contrib.comments_ renders use a single base template for all layouts.
This template is empty by default since it's only serves as a placeholder.
To complete the configuration of the comments module, create a ``comments/base.html`` file
that maps the template blocks onto your website base template. For example::

    {% extends "mysite/base.html" %}{% load i18n %}

    {% block headtitle %}{% block title %}{% trans "Responses for page" %}{% endblock %}{% endblock %}

    {% block main %}
        <div id="comments-wrapper">
            {% block content %}{% endblock %}
        </div>
    {% endblock %}

In this example, the base template has a ``headtitle`` and ``main`` block,
which contain the ``content`` and ``title`` blocks that django.contrib.comments_ needs to see.
This application also outputs an ``extrahead`` block for a meta-refresh tag.
The ``extrahead`` block can be included in the site base template directly,
so it doesn't have to be included in the ``comments/base.html`` file.


CSS form layout
---------------

Form layouts generally differ across web sites, hence this application doesn't dictate a specific form layout.
Instead, this application uses django-crispy-forms_ which allows configuration of the form appearance.
By default, the forms can be rendered with 2 well known CSS frameworks:

* `Bootstrap`_ The default template pack. The popular simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for user interfaces from Twitter.
* `Uni-form`_ Nice looking, well structured, highly customizable, accessible and usable forms.

The ``CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK`` setting can be used to switch between both layouts.
For more information, see the django-crispy-forms_ documentation.

Both CSS frameworks have a wide range of themes available, which should give a good head-start to have a good form layout.
In fact, we would encourage to adopt django-crispy-forms_ for all your applications to have a consistent layout across all your Django forms.

If your form CSS framework is not supported, you can create a template pack
for it and submit a pull request to the django-crispy-forms_ authors for inclusion.


Hiding form fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Form fields can be hidden using the following settings::

    FLUENT_COMMENTS_EXCLUDE_FIELDS = ('name', 'email', 'url')
    COMMENTS_APP = 'fluent_comments'

When `django-threadedcomments`_ in used, the ``title`` field can also be removed.


Comment moderation
------------------

Comment moderation can be enabled for the specific models using::


    from fluent_comments.moderation import moderate_model
    from myblog.models import BlogPost

    moderate_model(BlogPost,
        publication_date_field='publication_date',
        enable_comments_field='enable_comments',
    )

This code can be placed in a ``models.py`` file.
The provided field names are optional. By providing the field names,
the comments can be auto-moderated or auto-closed after a number of days since the publication date.

The following settings are available for comment moderation::

    AKISMET_API_KEY = "your-api-key"
    AKISMET_BLOG_URL = "http://example.com"        # Optional, to override auto detection
    AKISMET_IS_TEST = False                        # Enable to make test runs

    FLUENT_CONTENTS_USE_AKISMET = True             # Enabled by default when AKISMET_API_KEY is set.
    FLUENT_COMMENTS_CLOSE_AFTER_DAYS = None        # Auto-close comments after N days
    FLUENT_COMMENTS_MODERATE_AFTER_DAYS = None     # Auto-moderate comments after N days.
    FLUENT_COMMENTS_AKISMET_ACTION = 'moderate'    # Set to 'moderate' or 'delete'

To use Akismet_ moderation, make sure the ``AKISMET_API_KEY`` setting is defined.


E-mail notification
-------------------

By default, the ``MANAGERS`` of a Django site will receive an e-mail notification of new comments.
This feature can be enabled or disabled using::

    FLUENT_COMMENTS_USE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATION = True

The template ``comments/comment_notification_email.txt`` is used to generate the e-mail message.


Threaded comments
-----------------

There is build-in support for django-threadedcomments_ in this module.
It can be enabled using the following settings::

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'threadedcomments',
    )

    COMMENTS_APP = 'fluent_comments'

The templates and admin interface adapt themselves automatically
to show the threaded comments.


Javascript Controls
-------------------

You are able to control various output settings via javascript.

1. is_reversed: Will use prepend instead of append to insert the ajax created comment


Insert the following code, that does not wait for document.ready

```
<script>
var COMMENT_CONTROLS = {
    'is_reversed': true,
}
</script>
```

Contributing
